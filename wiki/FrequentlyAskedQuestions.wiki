===Q1. Are the entries exchanged in a strict FIFO manner?===

Yes all entries exchanged in a strict FIFO manner based on the claim sequence.

===Q2. Do you relax the consistency model to gain performance?===

No, all changes to the Entry are made immediately available to the Consumers of the !RingBuffer when the producer commits the changes via the !ProducerBarrier.  This is key to low-latency performance.
