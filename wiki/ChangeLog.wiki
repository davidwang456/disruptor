==Changes==

==1.2.1==
 * Bug fix for setting the sequence in the !ForceFillProducerBarrier.
 * Code syntax tidy up.

==1.2==
 * Bug fix for regression introduced inlining multi-thread producer commit tracking code.  This was a critical bug for the multi-threaded producer scenario.
 * Added new !ProducerBarrier method for claiming a batch of sequences.  This feature can give a significant throughput increase.

===1.1===
 * Off by one regression bug in !ProducerBarrier introduced in 1.0.9.
 * Clarified the algorithm for initial cursor value in the !ClaimStrategy.

===1.0.9===
 * Added Apache 2.0 licence and comments.
 * Small performance improvements to producers barriers and !BatchConsumer.

===1.0.8===
 * Bugfix for !BatchConsumer sequence update when using !SequenceTrackingHandler to ensure sequence is always updated at the end of a batch regardless.

===1.0.7===
 * Factored out !LifecycleAware interface to allowing consumers handlers to be notified when their thread starts and shuts down.

===1.0.6===
 * Cache minimum consumer sequence in producer barriers.  This helps make the performance more predictable on Nehalem processors and greater on earlier Core 2 processors.

===1.0.5===
 * Removed Entry interface.  All Entries must now extend !AbstractEntry.
 * Made setSequence package private on !AbstractEntry for encapsulation.
