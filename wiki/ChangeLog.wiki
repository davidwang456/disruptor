==Changes==

===1.0.9===
 * Added Apache 2.0 licence and comments.
 * Small performance improvements to producers barriers and !BatchConsumer.

===1.0.8===
 * Bugfix for !BatchConsumer sequence update when using !SequenceTrackingHandler to ensure sequence is always updated at the end of a batch regardless.

===1.0.7===
 * Factored out !LifecycleAware interface to allowing consumers handlers to be notified when their thread starts and shuts down.

===1.0.6===
 * Cache minimum consumer sequence in producer barriers.  This helps make the performance more predictable on Nehalem processors and greater on earlier Core 2 processors.

===1.0.5===
 * Removed Entry interface.  All Entries must now extend !AbstractEntry.
 * Made setSequence package private on !AbstractEntry for encapsulation.
